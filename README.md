# BinGO #
Version: 1.1
Launch Date: May 10th, 2024

## Description ##
This program creates a Python server and database that allows you to store and play many bingo cards subsequentially.

You can choose between 5 different colours, and store different sets of cards in different colours.

Called numbers can be entered and will automatically be highlighted according to the set win condition, and win condition can be changed live in play.

Both win conditions and cards can be easily added, and will be reusable upon repeat uses of the program.

This program makes for easy, large-scale playing of Bingo for people that may not have the space or capability to play physically.

## Highlights ##
- Fast.
- Accessible.
- Simplistic.
- Small; only ~136kb.

## Prerequisites ##
- Both Windows and MacOS are supported.
- Requires Python 3.12.3 or higher.
- Some knowledge of file directories is needed to run; nothing further is required.

## Installation ##
1. Visit https://github.com/KamrynVW/BinGO.

2. Click on the green '<> Code' button, and click 'Download ZIP' to download the program to your computer.

3. Right-click on the folder 'BinGO-main', and copy the file path of the folder.

4. Open your personal choice of terminal, and run the command 'python {Path to Folder}\binGO_server.py' (Be sure to remove any quotations that may appear around the pasted file path).

5. Open your personal choice of browser, and enter 'localhost:8000' into the top URL bar.

## Usage ##
The simplest usage is to create a card and free-play. The default win condition is every single tile on the Bingo card, meaning you can enter numbers and any that appear on the entered card will light up. If you want to customize the win condition, click 'Add Win Condition' and create it. This will automatically set the win condition to the newly created one, but you can always create more and switch between them using the 'Choose Win Condition' option.

This usage can be expanded as far as you would like, but do be aware that once you surpass 2000 cards at once, things do start to slow down.
